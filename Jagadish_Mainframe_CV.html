          <h4 style="color: blue;">Client Description: :</h4>
          <p style="color: blue;">Simon & Schuster was founded in 1924 by Richard L. Simon and M. Lincoln Schuster Simon & Schuster isa part of the CBS Corporation. <br>

            Simon & Schuster is a major force in today’s consumer publishing industry, dedicated to bringing anextensive cross section of first class information and entertainment, in all printed, digital, and audio formats, to a worldwide audience of readers.<br>
            
            Simon & Schuster consists of numerous prestigious and well known imprints, including Simon & Schuster,Pocket Books, Scribner, Free Press, Atria, Fireside, Touchstone, and Athenaeum Books for Young Readers, Little Simon, Simon Spotlight, and Simon Spotlight Entertainment <br>
            
            Simon & Schuster publishes approximately 1800 titles annually. <br>
            
            Simon & Schuster has 1500 employees and can distribute its titles in more than 100 countries and territoriesaround the world. <br>
            
            Simon & Schuster has publishing and distribution capabilities in the United States, Canada, the UnitedKingdom and Australia, as well as an international sales presence in every major market. <br>
             <h4 style="color: blue;">About the project :</h4> 
            <p style="color: blue;">Simon & Schuster basically deals with the Order Processing system wherein the orders are tracked right from the booking to the shipment stage. The accounts, inventory processing etc. are taken care by the existing COBOL and Java applications. This Project involves the migration of certain COBOL and java programs into dot net web based applications. It also involves the WMS project which is related to the interface between the UOPS (Universal Order Processing System) and WMS (Work order Management System) applications which basically deals with the database activities such as up gradation of the database tables. The WMS project is related to the interface between UOPS (Universal Order Processing System) and WMS (Work order Management System) applications. On a daily/weekly basis, the data from UOPS applications is shared with WMS applications. <br>
                The data sharing part is done in a 3 step process: <br>

                1	Load the UOPS data into WMS_* tables <br>
                
                2	Download the Data from WMS_* tables in to files <br>
                
                3	FTP the files to WMS servers <br>
                The loading of WMS tables is done by couple of COBOL programs.<br>
                </p>

                <h4 style="color: blue;">Scope of the project:</h4>
                <p style="color: blue;">The current application is a Mainframe application, consisting of the COBOL batch Programs and the DB2 database. In addition to the above set of programs there are other types of programs in the inventory comprising of assembler programs and some EDI interfaces. The need is to migrate the existing Legacy applications to .net platform minimizing risk and code changes hence the decision to migrate to COBOL.Net. The Migrated COBOL should be run in the .Net development environment and needs to incorporate with other .Net Programming languages. e.g., C#, VB.Net</p>
